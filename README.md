This data selected six major cities from the dataset to categorize the type of subsidized housing availability in each city. For this visualization, non-profit and combination subsidized housing units were de-emphasized to indicate the availability of for-profit units. While Oakland and Pittsburgh were more evenly split between for-profit and non-profit or combination units avaiable, the first four cities had a greater or much greater availability of for-profit subsidized housing units in 2017.

Each row in this dataset represents information about either the property or the occupants of subsidized housing units. The unique identifier in my dataset is called the Object ID. It has 9 measures and 11 dimensions. According to this data, Baltimore had an average amount of subsidized housing residents in 2017.

This visualization focuses on two major counties in three cities (Atlanta, Baltimore, and New Orleans) to discover which county and city had the most active subsidized housing units. Fulton County had the greatest subsidized housing availability in 2017 with a total of 11 units. Atlanta similarly had the greatest subisidized housing availability of the three cities measured.

## Conclusion ##
This project holds some interesting implications. Although the dataset covered availability of subsidized housing in 2017, it indicates how the public sector and private companies chose to invest in lower-income communities. It would be interesting to collect more recent data to measure any changes.
